how do we manage clinical trial data?
	dozens a day, free text, how do we make sense?
	clinical trials.gov is the go-to
emphasis
	eligibility criteria
	mapping words / terms to tags i.e. person, condition
screening
	cut the 
	are eligibility criteria changing over the last six weeks?
	how do criteria depend on location
aact trial info ; aggregate analysis of clinical trials data
	discriminative information about covid
other file: all the eligibility criteria we have for a given domain
	person, visit, observation ()

uses 
	given a small subset of documents, how do you label it

population similarity; not concept similarity
	two t2 diabetes trials
		both have same set of concepts BMI, hypertensions, a1c, etc
		concepts look similar, but thresholds are different so they're looking at two very different populations
	visualization of results
		former postdoc did a study on mapping trials onto a map

ML/DL
tons of data on eligibility criteria on covid19 trials
	rules on who can join the clinical trial (i.e. need to have covid, need to be pregnant, not have a compromised liver, etc)
	clinicaltrials.gov has tons of data but not accessible
temporal analysis
	over last two months, how have the criteria changed?
	have they changed, how has it changed?
	low level: eligibility criteria, start date -> bin trials into a certain range
	next level: using the values for measurements
	high level: patient profiles
can we start identifying trial competition
	40 trials in nyc, say they exclude heart disease or liver disease
	those trials are targeting the same patient population
with all the data, what can we do to visualize it?
some info
	concept: (omac, odyssey) have a common data model which is a gigantic medical dictionary
		nct_id = clinical trial id (national clinical trial id or something)_ was added for subgroup of clinical trial if there are subgroups
		eligibility criteria: must have inclusion criteria, can't have exclusion
		d a child of e, one-to-one d to c
		negation: 
		don't use include or negation: they are used for creating is_exclusion
		don't use concept_group
		h through j are unnecessary for a analysis, just used to construct the concept
		before days i.e. no back surgery i last 60 days
			very large numbers are default when nothing is specified
		use a, d, e, p are first pass
		other file: has the date the trial was scheduled to start (column b)
			phases: 1=can a patient tolerate this?, 2=how high can you dose until someone gets sick?, 3=showing it works (usually this is the kicker, submitted to fda), 4=drugs have been approved and now they're back in research (i.e. hydroxychloroquine)
		study_type: interventional=we're giving you an intervention, observational=we're calling you to see how you feel, expanded access=giving access to doctors to use outside of its standard care (easier alternative to phase 3 trial), conditions=target condition, intervention, healthy=wheethr healthy volunteers are allowed, zip_codes=zip codes for all facilities that have this trail (important for competition analysis) (pyzipcode is easy to use and to determine nearby zip codes, i.e. list all zip codes within 20 miles)
			temporal: a, b, d, e, n (den for stratifying temporal analysis by trial characteristic, den are step two columns), i, j, k are all criteria
			for the location: m
FOR NEXT WEEK: lowest is a better understanding of what coding will go into BOTH OF THESE projects for an MVP, hopefully some coding



MVP:
Temporal Analysis:
	Fit some nonparametric functions to measure changes in percentage of clinical trials with any given inc/exc + concept criteria OR histogram over a more fine range
	Patient profiles: deterministic, logic based on concepts, inc/exc, location?
	
Geography 
	Get data on global clinical trial patients and their location and conditions
	WITHOUT THE ABOVE ^
		get a matrix of number of overlapping criteria between all pairs of clinical trials, at least those within a certain distance
		give warnings about which trials are most similar in a nearby distance
		create a map with plotted clinical trials locations by zip code
	WITH THE ABOVE
		show what patient populations have lots of overlap, i.e. competing for the same 40% of the population, show the correlation among different concepts
